<div class="container">

		<p> We're going to extend the rocket race game so you fly through the galaxy! If you haven't already done <a href="./rocket-race.html">Rocket Race</a>, do it now.</p>

		<p> 1) Lets make an array that has all the sprites we want to move. Whenever we make a planet or star, we should add it to this array. (Hint: It's fine to have a sprite in multiple arrays)</p>

		<p> 2) We're going to change what happens when the rocket hits the edge of the screen. Instead of having it go to the other edge, we want to move everything (including the rocket) back towards the center of the screen. </p>

		<p>3) Make the rocket start moving everything before it hits the edge so you can see where you're going. </p>

		<p>4) (Optional) To smooth out the movement of the screen, we want everything to move back onto the screen just enough to put the rocket on the threshold of moving the screen. </p>
    <br><p> Make sure your project is saved, then try replacing your if statement with a while loop. (Just replace 'if' with 'while'). You can then make everything move less each time because it will happen multiple times </p>
    <br><p> What is the difference between a while loop and an if statement? A while loop and a forever loop?</p>

		<p>5) (Optional) Make a "soft" threshold that makes the rocket move back towards the center of screen slowly. </p>

		<p>6) (Optional) Add a "compass" sprite that stays on top of your rocket and points towards where your rocket started. You may need additional variables to keep track of where it should be pointing towards.</p>
