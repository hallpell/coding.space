		<p>We're going to build a media player to let the user control playing a song.</p>
		<br><a target="_blank" href="./code/media-player-code.html">Play this demo in full screen.</a>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
		<p>1) Choose a song and make it play as the project loads.</p>
		<br><a target="_blank" href="./snippets/media-player-step1.html">Play this demo in full screen.</a>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
		<p>2) Add a sprite to the a pause button, and make it pause the sound when you click it.</p>
		<br><a target="_blank" href="./snippets/media-player-step2.html">Play this demo in full screen.</a>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
		<p>3) Add a sprite to the a play button, and make it play the sound when you click it.</p>
		<br><a target="_blank" href="./snippets/media-player-step3.html">Play this demo in full screen.</a>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
		<p>4) Add a sprite to the a stop button, and make it stop the sound when you click it. (Stop will reset the sound back to the beginning when you play it next)</p>
		<br><a target="_blank" href="./snippets/media-player-step4.html">Play this demo in full screen.</a>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
		<p>5) Bonus: Add a display for the user to see if the sound is currently paused.</p>
		<br><a target="_blank" href="./snippets/media-player-step5.html">Play this demo in full screen.</a>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
		<p>6) Add text that displays the volume of the sound.</p>
		<br><a target="_blank" href="./snippets/media-player-step6.html">Play this demo in full screen.</a>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
		<p>7) Add a way to adjust the volume of the sound. This could be sprites to click that adjust the volume up/down, choosing keys that will adjust the volume, or (as a challenge) a slider that can be clicked and/or dragged to adjust the volume.</p>
		<br><a target="_blank" href="./snippets/media-player-step7.html">Play this demo in full screen.</a>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
		<p>8) Display and allow adjustment of the current time of your sound, similar to the volume.</p>
		<br><a target="_blank" href="./snippets/media-player-step8.html">Play this demo in full screen.</a>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
		<p>9) Challenge: Can you allow the user to swap between different sounds? How much code can be shared between different sounds?</p>
